# sas-macro-lib
Handy SAS macros created for variable selection

# Purpose
This is part of my SAS library that I intended to showcase how a standardized SAS environment could look like. Each time when a new project is created, one should call %include "" to initialize the standard macro libraries similar to the ways in other general-purpose programming languages.
